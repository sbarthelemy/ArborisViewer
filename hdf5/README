This directory contains the static binary distribution of HDF5 1.8.3
that was compiled on Linux 2.6 i686. 

It includes the C, C++, and F90 APIs, built using the following
compilers:  gcc 4.1.2, g95, g++

For information on compilers and settings used to build these HDF5 
libraries, please refer to:

    ./lib/libhdf5.settings

The contents of this directory are:

    COPYING     - Copyright notice
    README      - This file
    RELEASE.txt - Detailed information regarding this release
    bin/        - Directory containing HDF5 pre-compiled utilities
    include/    - Directory containing HDF5 include files
    lib/        - Directory containing HDF5 libraries and settings

These binaries were built with, but do NOT include the ZLIB and
SZIP (version 2.0 or 2.1, Encoder ENABLED) external libraries.

As a convenience we provide the ZLIB and SZIP binaries and source
code on the HDF ftp server at:

    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/

The official ZLIB and SZIP pages are at:

    ZLIB: http://www.zlib.net/
    SZIP: http://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/

We provide scripts for compiling applications with the HDF5 libraries:

    bin/h5cc  - for C
    bin/h5fc  - for F90 (if Fortran 90 is included with the binaries)
    bin/h5c++ - for C++ (if C++ is included with the binaries)

After you have installed the binaries to their final destination,
you can use these scripts (h5cc, h5fc, h5c++) to compile.  However,
you must first:

  1) Run ./h5redeploy to change site specific paths in the scripts.

  2) Edit each script and update the paths for the external libraries
     in LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS.

You may also need to change other variables in the scripts, depending
on how things are set up on your system.  Here are some of the variables
to check:

  prefix      - Path to the HDF5 top level installation directory
  CCBASE      - Name of the alternative C compiler
  CLINKERBASE - Name of the alternative linker
  LIBS        - Libraries your application will link with


If there is a need to build from source, the HDF5 source code can be
found on the HDF ftp server in:

    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src/

Refer to the INSTALL files in the ./release_docs/ directory of the
HDF5 source code for instructions on building:

    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src/unpacked/release_docs/
